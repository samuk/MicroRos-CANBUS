# MicroRos-CANBUS
Attempt to get CANBUS motor control for GYEMS RMD series of motors http://www.gyems.cn/product.html on ESP32 and MicroROS.

Sketch is based on https://www.seeedstudio.com/CAN-BUS-Shield-V2.html hardware.

It would be good to get it working on https://www.skpang.co.uk/collections/can-bus-boards/products/esp32-can-bus-board 
Example code is here: https://github.com/samuk/ESP32_CAN-Bus_demo/blob/master/ESP32_CAN-Bus_demo.ino
